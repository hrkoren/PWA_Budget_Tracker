## PWA Online/Offline Budget Tracker

## Description

Use the budget tracker to meet your financial goals from anywhere - whether you are online or offline. All offline transactions will be stored in your local cache, and when you are back online, they will be added to the database, so you don't need to worry about losing your transactions while out and about.
